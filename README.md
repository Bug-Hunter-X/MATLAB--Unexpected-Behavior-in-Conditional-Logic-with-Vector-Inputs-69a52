This repository demonstrates an uncommon MATLAB error related to array indexing within conditional statements when the input is a vector or matrix. The provided code snippet showcases the problematic function, and the solution illustrates a corrected version that handles vector and matrix inputs correctly.  The original function produces unexpected results for vector or matrix inputs due to MATLAB's behavior with logical indexing in conditional statements. The solution refactors the code to handle these cases correctly using element-wise operations.
